delft3dfm_202x.0x_lnx64_sif0x.tar.gz:
1. Download and install Singularity: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/introduction.html
2. Unpack the delft3dfm-Singularity-sif-file with the runscript "execute_singularity.sh". Keep them together in the same directory.
   Do not place multiple sif-files in the same directory.
3. Edit "execute_singularity.sh": it must refer to an existing IntelMPI installation on your system.
4. Copy into your working folder: "run_singularity.sh" and/or "submit_singularity.sh"
   They are example scripts for executing Singularity computations. You'll need to modify them for your own needs.
   "Working folder" is the location of your dimr configuration file.
