!> Functionality to store user input for forcings (e.g., time series), to be processed later by a kernel.
!! For example, a pump's capacity may be prescribed by a time series in a .bc file.
!! The flow1d structure reader only reads all user-supplied input, and later it is up to
!! the calling kernel to initialize that forcing provider, and get time-interpolated values from it.
