!> Sets initial water level based on a 'flood fill' that originates from
!! the active sample points.
!!
!! The active samples are used as starting points, with their z-values as
!! initial water level. This level spreads out to all surrounding cells,
!! until a higher bottom (shore) is encountered, or a flood front from one
!! of the other samples.
!! Also used by flow_flowinit() for the <tt>WaterLevIniFile</tt> from the MDU.
