	* sigwatch.c, README, etc: Added GPL apparatus.  Modified
	watchsignal and watchsignalname so that they return -1 on error,
	and +1 as a warning, if a preexisting non-default signal handler
	was replaced.

	* sigwatch.3: Clarified slightly, and added notes about
	re-throwing signals, and the problems associated with this.
