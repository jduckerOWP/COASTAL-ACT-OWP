!> Computes and sets the widths and gate lower edge levels on each of the flow links
!! crossed by a general structure (gate/weir/true genstru).
!! This is now an extended version of SOBEK's setLineStructure, because it also enables
!! a sideways closing gate with two doors from the left and right side, where the partially
!! closed portions have gate flow, and the center open portion still only has normal weir
!! flow across the sill.
