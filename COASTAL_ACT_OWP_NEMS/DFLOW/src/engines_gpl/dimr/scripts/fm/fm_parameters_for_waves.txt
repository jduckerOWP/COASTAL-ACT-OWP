Wavemodelnr                         = 3
Rouwav                              = FR84
Gammax                              = 1.                                 #Maximum wave height/water depth ratio



BedlevMode                       = 2                                   # 1: FM                 approach: Bed levels at waterlevel cells based on bed levels at velocity points
   probably only needed to get a good comparison with Delft3D-FLOW

CFLWaveFrac                      = 0.1                                 # Wave velocity fraction, total courant vel = u + cflw*wavevelocity
   not sure if this really is needed

Epshu                            = 0.05                                # Threshold water depth for wet and dry cells
   a big epshu is important in some cases

UnifFrictCoef                    = 0.0210000                           # Uniform friction coefficient (0: no friction)
   a frictcoef of 0.0 will blow up the simulation

EulerVelocities                     = 1
