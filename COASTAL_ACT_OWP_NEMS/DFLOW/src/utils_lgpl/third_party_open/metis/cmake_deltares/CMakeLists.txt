# This file is an adjusted CMakeLists.txt that is defined by the Metis directory.
# The following adjustments were made:
# - CMake version prerequisite.
# - Excluded the subdirectory "programs" as this is not necessary for the OSS usage of the metis library.
# - Setting the source path and the headers include path
