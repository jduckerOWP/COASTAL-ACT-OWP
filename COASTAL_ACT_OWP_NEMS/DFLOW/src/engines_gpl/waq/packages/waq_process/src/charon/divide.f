!           check for overflow before dividing.  if result will be
!        greater than or equal to largest value set result to plus or
!        minus ''infinity''.  aquot contains the number that represents
!        infinity.  it was chosen so that it could be recognized on
!        output.
!           subprogram start sets the values for anumbr and aquot.
!        anumlg is the logarithm of anumbr.  iquot is a toggle.  it is
!        zero if no overflow, one if overflow.
!           divide uses double precision version of
