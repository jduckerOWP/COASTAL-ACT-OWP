To generate the shared object (.dll on WINDOWS ; .so on UNIX) do the following:

- WINDOWS:

	Open the solution file (.sln; one directory higher) and build the solution (in Release or Debug mode)
	The generated .dll file is placed in the bin directory at that directory level.

- LINUX:

	In the LINUX-shell in this directory type: make -f Makefile_external
	The generated .so file is placed directly in this directory.

When using the .so on LINUX:
Add the directory containing the .so file to environment parameter LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Example line:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u/myname/src/plugin_delftflow_traform/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
