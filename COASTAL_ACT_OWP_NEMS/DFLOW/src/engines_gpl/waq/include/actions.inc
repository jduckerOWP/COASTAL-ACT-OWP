!     Parameters defining the actions for DELWAQ in DLL form
!
!     I have also thought about 'step' or 'phase' instead of 'action'
!     but as long as a fullcomputation is also part of this list,
!     these other names don't make sense. One option would be to
!     have each phase correspond to a specific bit and to have all
!     bits set in a fullcomputation, but a fullcomputation is more
!     than initialisation followed by a single step and finalisation.
!     'task' may be a better alternative for action
!
      integer, parameter :: ACTION_INITIALISATION  = 1
      integer, parameter :: ACTION_FINALISATION    = 2
      integer, parameter :: ACTION_SINGLESTEP      = 3
      integer, parameter :: ACTION_FULLCOMPUTATION = 4
