This directory contains the Fortran interface to KDTREE 2, exported from
https://github.com/jmhodges/kdtree2 on Nov 11, 2013.
More original and license information in kdtree-README and LICENSE.

Additional configuration in this directoy:
   * Autotools (autoconf+automake) setup for inclusion in other
     autotools-based packages.
   * Use libtool to produce both static and dynamic libraries.
     (libkdtree2f)

Inclusion in your own package:
   * In your own package's configure.ac include:

     AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([third_party_open/kdtree2])

     This will run configure recursively when invoked from your toplevel
     package directory.
   * In your own package's toplevel Makefile.am include:

     SUBDIRS = third_party_open/kdtree2
   * In the Makefile.am that builds your source files that need kdtree2
     include:
     FCFLAGS = -I$(top_builddir)/third_party_open/kdtree2/src-f90

     LDADD = $(top_builddir)/third_party_open/kdtree2/src-f90/libkdtree2f.la

Building instructions/
   * Run ./autogen.sh in this kdtree2 dir (and possibly your own package's
     toplevel dir) to generate missing libtool and autotools files.
   * Just run ./configure in your package's toplevel dir. kdtree2 will inherit
     the Fortran compiler, but needs no further configuration settings.
   * Run make in your package's toplevel dir.
