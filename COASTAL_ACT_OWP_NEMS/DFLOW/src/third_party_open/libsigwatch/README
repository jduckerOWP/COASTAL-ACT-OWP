libsigwatch library
-------------------

libsigwatch.a is a library of routines to provide simple signal
watching for Fortran programs.  This allows a minimal level of control
of a running program from outside it, for example to tell it to
checkpoint itself on receipt of a signal.  Signal handling is rather
tricky in Fortran (because the function that is registered as a signal
handler is later called by value rather than by reference), so this
library provides functions to make it easier.

See INSTALL for installation instructions (basically the usual
`./configure; make; make install').   See the manual page sigwatch.3
for more detailed documentation (a formatted version is included in
the distribution as sigwatch.3.txt).
